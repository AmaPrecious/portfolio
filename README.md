**Sales Data Analysis**
-Utilized excel table and Power Bi to clean and analyze a dataset. From the analysis, i was able to identify trends like the top-selling products, the revenue metrics such as total sales and profit margins. From the dataset, I was able to manipulate and derive insights and created visualizations to present my findings effectively.

The first page provided an overview of all the four dashboards i created. the second page included the demographics insights, the third page focused on turnover 1, the fourth page on turnover analysis 2, and the last page was dedicated to to employee wellness.

**SQL Capstone Project (DVD Rental Analysis)**
-I crafted SQL queries focusing on using SELECT statements to retrieve and manipulate data, filtering and sorting data, aggregating and grouping data, performing join operations, creating views and stored procedures, handling data cleaning and valifdation, and performance optimization. I also used SQL queries and transformation techniques to extract valuable insights and presented my findings and recommendations.
